# Comp_410_Data_Structures

Course Description (Directly from syllabus):
This course will teach you how to organize the data used in computer programs so that manipulation of that data can be done efficiently on large problems and instances.  Rather than learning to use the data structures found in the libraries of programming languages, you will be learning how those libraries are constructed, and why the items that are included in them are there (and why some are excluded).  
    •	You will gain familiarity with important categories of problems that are commonly encountered in software development, and will learn what data organizations will allow practical and efficient solutions to those problems. 
    •	You will learn the basics of how to describe and analyze the performance and efficiency of your algorithms; this will prepare you for the upper level course in Algorithms Analysis. 
    •	You will demonstrate the concepts you learn by encoding them in correct Java programs. 
    •	You will gain more proficiency in basic programming and in constructing larger programs than you have been doing in your intro classes. 
    •	You will practice the induction proof method learned in your background computational math course.  
    •	You will learn the basic structure of the Java Collections library and demonstrate an understanding of its utility by employing some of its basic components in your Java programs for more advanced data structures.
    •	Mastery of the data structures taught in this course will prepare you to study higher level areas where those data structures are heavily used: operating systems, networking, graphics, image processing, compilers, databases, robotics to name a few.
